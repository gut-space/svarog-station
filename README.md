This is the code for a fully functional automated VHF satellite ground station. It can operate on it own,
but can also upload observations to the [Svarog server](https://github.com/gut-space/svarog-server).


The goal of this project is to build a fully functional automated VHF satellite ground station, loosely based on [satnogs](https://satnogs.org) project.

Project founders: [SÅ‚awek Figiel](https://github.com/fivitti) and [Tomek Mrugalski](https://github.com/tomaszmrugalski/)

## Project status

As of July 2025, the process is being revived after couple years of dormancy. In the past, the code was able to do:

- Scheduling of NOAA and METEOR sat passes, trigger and shutdown reception routines
- Automated reception and decoding for NOAA-15, NOAA-18 and NOAA-19 satellites (APT)
- Automated reception and decoding for Meteor M2 transmissions (LRPT)
- Uploading decoded data to Svarog server (see https://svarog.space)
- Automated updates for the server and station
- Orbital TLE data is updated automatically
- Pass over charts (azimuth/elevation)
- Quality assessment for decoded images
