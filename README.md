This is the code for a fully functional automated VHF satellite ground station. It can operate on it own,
but can also upload observations to the [Svarog server](https://github.com/gut-space/svarog-server).


The goal of this project is to build a fully functional automated VHF satellite ground station, loosely based on [satnogs](https://satnogs.org) project.

Project founders: [SÅ‚awek Figiel](https://github.com/fivitti) and [Tomek Mrugalski](https://github.com/tomaszmrugalski/)

## Project status

As of Feb 2021, the following features are working:

- WiMo TA-1 and QFH antennas, SDR and RPi4 are working
- Automated reception and transmission decoding for NOAA-15, NOAA-18 and NOAA-19 satellites (APT)
- Support for Meteor M2 transmissions (LRPT)
- Transmissions are decoded and uploaded automatically to our content server (see https://svarog.space)
- Automated updates for the server and station
- Orbital TLE data is recorded and prestend in several formats (native TLE, easy to understand orbital parameters etc.)
- Pass over charts (azimuth/elevation)

Work in progress and plans for the near future:

- quality assessment for decoded images
- user management
- georeferencing
- telemetry reception
